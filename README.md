# Pregnancy Risk Calculator prototype web application

A prototype website for helping pregnant people find the best quality care for their pregnancy journey by calculating their risks for various pregnancy complications and what actions they can take to mitigate these risks.

This is based entirely on the work of the [WinTech Owls](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Hacker-s-Hub/WinTech-Owls-Risk-Calculator-for-Expecting-Mothers/ta-p/861272) team for their use and at their discretion.
